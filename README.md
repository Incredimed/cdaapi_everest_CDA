CDAAPI.Everest
==============
This is an extract of the code from the Everest Framework ( http://te.marc-hi.ca/view.aspx?project=af66d54ed41e4ac18b44d0d3ca6cabf0 )

The code is limited to that required to handle the HL7V3 datatypes for CDA R2.
Amendments have been made to relect localisations required for the CDA profiles published by the NHS (England)
